After my first CS class I got hooked on\r\nprogramming and instead of going back to school to finish up a CS degree I am\r\nattending a coding bootcamp in Silicon Valley (Coding House). \r\n\r\nWhen I'm not coding you will most likely find me doing one of the following:\r\nreading, working on my latest startup idea, playing with my dog, analyzing\r\ndata, eating, running,practicing guitar, taking a walk outside, or re-watching\r\nepisodes of The Office for about the 10th time.\r\n  \r\n##Find me on the Web \r\n* [My Blog](http://www.thomaswolfeblog.wordpress.com)\r\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/twolfe2) \r\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tewolfe2) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
