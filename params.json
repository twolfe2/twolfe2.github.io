While at UIUC I studied Statistics and during my Senior year\r\nI started taking CS classes. After my first CS class I got hooked on\r\nprogramming and instead of going back to school to finish up a CS degree I am\r\nattending a coding bootcamp in Silicon Valley (Coding House). When I'm not\r\ncoding you will most likely find me doing one of the following:\r\nreading, working on my latest startup idea, playing with my dog, analyzing\r\ndata, eating, running,practicing guitar, taking a walk outside, or re-watching\r\nepisodes of The Office for about the 10th time.\r\n  \r\n##Find me on the Web \r\n*[My Blog](thomaswolfeblog.wordpress.com)\r\n*[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/twolfe2) \r\n*[Twitter](https://twitter.com/tewolfe2) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
